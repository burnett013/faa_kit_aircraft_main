### Hi, Iâ€™m Andy ðŸ¤Ÿ

### This Project in a Nutshell
**FAA Kit Aircraft (FAA Kits, Kits) Explorer** is a full-stack app for exploring kit-built aircraft registered in the U.S.

- **Stack:** FastAPI â€¢ PostgreSQL â€¢ SQLAlchemy â€¢ Pandas â€¢ Streamlit  
- **Data:** FAA registry (cleaned & modeled), with a dedicated API layer  
- **Features:** manufacturer/model filters, regional stats, and quick visualizations

---

### Recent Work
- **FAA Full Dataset (300k+ rows):** Sourced, cleaned, and structured the national aircraft registry, forming a foundation for aviation analytics.
- **FAA Kits Dataset (16k+ rows):** Built this end-to-end app (API + DB + UI) to explore kit aircraftâ€”combining data engineering, modeling, and visualization.

---
I recently completed an **M.S. in Artificial Intelligence & Business Analytics (3.8 GPA)** at the University of South Floridaâ€™s Muma College of Business, building on a **B.S. in Entrepreneurship (cum laude)**.  
My work lives at the intersection of **data, design, and decision-making**â€”turning raw data into tools people actually use.

---

### How I Work
I like solving messy problems, telling clear stories with data, and building systems that make decisions easier.  
Itâ€™s never just numbersâ€”itâ€™s **context, clarity, and usability**.

---

### Values I Bring
Former **combat medic**, Afghanistan veteran. That experience taught me to stay calm in uncertainty, focus on what matters, and lead with empathy.  
I show up with **resilience, clarity, and commitment** in everything I build.

---

### What Drives Me
Work that matters: blending **data + design + strategy** to bring clarity to complex questionsâ€”whether thatâ€™s a pipeline, a visualization, or an insight that changes direction.
